# CustomerServiceMetricTaskCollection

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**href** | **string** | The URI of the current page of results. | [optional] 
**limit** | **int** | The value of the limit parameter submitted in the request, which is the maximum number of tasks to return per page, from the result set. A result set is the complete set of tasks returned by the method. Note: Even though this parameter is not required to be submitted in the request, the parameter defaults to 10 if omitted. Note: If this is the last or only page of the result set, the page may contain fewer tasks than the limit value. To determine the number of pages in a result set, divide the total value (total number of tasks matching input criteria) by this limit value, and then round up to the next integer. For example, if the total value was 120 (120 total tasks) and the limit value was 50 (show 50 tasks per page), the total number of pages in the result set is three, so the seller would have to make three separate getCustomerServiceMetricTasks calls to view all tasks matching the input criteria. | [optional] 
**next** | **string** | The relative path to the call URI for the next page of results. This value is returned if there is an additional page of results to return from the result set. | [optional] 
**offset** | **int** | The number of results skipped in the result set before returning the first result. This value can be set in the request with the offset query parameter. Note: The items in a paginated result set use a zero-based list where the first item in the list has an offset of 0. | [optional] 
**prev** | **string** | The URI for the previous page of results. This parameter is returned if a previous page of results from the result set exists. | [optional] 
**tasks** | [**\SwaggerEbayFeedApi\Client\Model\ServiceMetricsTask[]**](ServiceMetricsTask.md) | An array of the customer service tasks on this page. The tasks are sorted by creation date. An empty array is returned if the filter criteria excludes all tasks. | [optional] 
**total** | **int** | The total number of tasks that match the criteria. | [optional]
